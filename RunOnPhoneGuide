# 📱 Running Push-Up Counter on Your Samsung S25 Ultra

This guide will help you run the push-up counter on your Samsung S25 Ultra.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Start the Server on Your Computer

```bash
python serve.py
```

You'll see output like this:
```
============================================================
🏋️  Push-Up Counter Web Server Running!
============================================================

📱 Access from your Samsung S25 Ultra:

   Open browser and go to:

   http://192.168.1.100:8080

   (Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network)

============================================================
```

### Step 2: Open on Your Phone

1. **Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network** as your computer
2. Open **Samsung Internet** or **Chrome** on your phone
3. Type the URL shown in the terminal (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`)
4. Press Enter

### Step 3: Grant Camera Permissions

When prompted:
1. Tap **"Allow"** to grant camera access
2. The camera view should appear immediately

### Step 4: Position Yourself

1. **Use landscape mode** (rotate phone sideways)
2. **Use back camera** for better quality (tap "Flip" if needed)
3. **Position camera** to see your full body:
   - Should see shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles
   - Side view works best
4. **Get into plank position**:
   - Legs straight
   - Body horizontal
   - Face pointing down

### Step 5: Start Counting!

- Watch for **"✓ READY"** indicator (green, top right)
- Do push-ups with proper form
- Counter will increment automatically
- See your metrics in real-time

## 📋 Requirements

### On Your Computer

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Same WiFi network as your phone
- Files:
  - `serve.py`
  - `web/index.html`
  - `web/pushup_counter.js`

### On Your Phone (Samsung S25 Ultra)

- Modern browser (Samsung Internet, Chrome, Firefox)
- Camera access enabled
- Same WiFi network as computer

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Controls

- **Reset Button**: Reset rep counter to 0
- **Flip Button**: Switch between front and back camera

### Status Indicators

**Position Status (Top Right):**
- `✓ READY` (green) = In proper push-up position, counting enabled
- `✗ INVALID POS` (red) = Not in position, counting disabled

**Metrics (Bottom Left):**
- **Elbow**: Current elbow angle
- **Arm-Back**: Arm-to-back parallelism (green [PARALLEL] when good)
- **Knee**: Knee angle (green when straight)

### Warning Messages

If you see a red warning banner:
```
⚠️ NOT IN PUSH-UP POSITION
Legs bent (145° < 160°)
```

Fix the issue mentioned:
- **"Legs bent"** → Straighten your legs
- **"Not horizontal"** → Get into plank position
- **"Face not pointing down"** → Look at the ground

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working

**Problem**: Camera doesn't start or shows black screen

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser permissions:
   - Settings → Apps → [Browser] → Permissions → Camera → Allow
2. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Samsung Internet)
3. Reload the page (pull down to refresh)
4. Make sure no other app is using the camera

### Can't Connect to Server

**Problem**: Phone shows "Can't reach this page"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify both devices on same WiFi:
   - Computer: Check WiFi name
   - Phone: Settings → Connections → WiFi
2. Check firewall isn't blocking port 8080:
   - Windows: Allow Python through firewall
   - Mac: System Preferences → Security → Firewall
3. Try the IP address shown in terminal exactly
4. Restart the server (`Ctrl+C`, then `python serve.py` again)

### "INVALID POS" Won't Go Away

**Problem**: Shows "INVALID POS" even when in position

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure camera can see your **full body**:
   - Shoulders, hips, knees, ankles must be visible
2. Get into **proper plank**:
   - Legs straight (knees locked)
   - Body parallel to ground
   - Face looking down
3. Adjust camera distance/angle
4. Better lighting helps pose detection

### Counting Not Working

**Problem**: Reps not counting

**Checks**:
1. Is position indicator showing `✓ READY` (green)?
   - If red, fix your position first
2. Are you reaching the target angles?
   - Elbow should go to ~80° at bottom
   - Elbow should go to >120° at top
   - Arm-Back should show `[PARALLEL]`
3. Are you holding each position briefly?
   - Don't go too fast
   - Pause at bottom and top

### Laggy Performance

**Problem**: Camera feed is slow or choppy

**Solutions**:
1. Close other apps on your phone
2. Use better lighting (helps processing)
3. Move closer to WiFi router
4. Try front camera (usually faster)

## 📱 Optimal Phone Placement

### Best Positions

**Option 1: Side View (Recommended)**
```
                 [Phone on stand]
                      ↓
    You doing push-ups →  ║
    (side view)           ║
```
- Best for form analysis
- Can see full body alignment
- Mount phone on stand/prop

**Option 2: Angled View**
```
         [Phone at 45°]
              ↙
    You doing push-ups
    (angled side view)
```
- Good compromise
- Easier to see screen
- Still captures form well

### Phone Mounting Tips

- Use a **phone stand** or **tripod**
- **Prop against books/wall** in landscape mode
- **2-3 meters away** for full body view
- **Camera at chest height** when in plank

## 🎯 Getting Accurate Counts

### Form Requirements

For a rep to count, you must:

1. ✅ **Start extended** (elbow > 120°)
2. ✅ **Go down to 80°** (±30° tolerance)
3. ✅ **Keep arm parallel to back** (<40° difference)
4. ✅ **Return to extended** (elbow > 120°)

### Position Requirements

Counter only works when:

1. ✅ **Legs straight** (knee angle > 160°)
2. ✅ **Body horizontal** (plank position)
3. ✅ **Face pointing down**

### Tips for Best Results

- 🔥 **Good lighting** - helps pose detection significantly
- 📏 **Full body visible** - shoulders to ankles on screen
- 🎯 **Side angle** - 45-90° from straight-on
- ⚡ **Stable camera** - no shaking or movement
- 👕 **Fitted clothing** - helps keypoint detection

## ⚙️ Advanced Settings

### Adjusting Counting Sensitivity

To make counting more lenient, edit `pushup_counter.js`:

```javascript
// In PushupCounter constructor (around line 8)
this.downAngle = 80;           // Lower = need less depth
this.angleTolerance = 30;      // Higher = more forgiving
this.upThreshold = 120;        // Lower = less extension needed
this.parallelThreshold = 40;   // Higher = less strict on form
```

### Disabling Position Validation

In `pushup_counter.js`, line 235, change:

```javascript
// From:
if (this.positionValid) {
    const repCompleted = this.counter.update(elbowAvg, armBackDiff);

// To:
if (true) {  // Always allow counting
    const repCompleted = this.counter.update(elbowAvg, armBackDiff);
```

## 🌐 Alternative: No Server Needed

You can also open `index.html` directly in your phone's browser:

1. Copy `web` folder to your phone
2. Open Files app
3. Navigate to folder
4. Tap `index.html`
5. Choose browser

**Note**: Camera may not work due to browser security. Using the server is recommended.

## 📊 What You'll See

### During Use

- **Real-time skeleton overlay** on camera view
- **Rep counter** in top left
- **Position status** in top right
- **Live angle measurements** at bottom
- **Score popup** after each rep

### When Counting

```
Rep 1 Complete!
Rep Score: 85/100
```

- Score appears briefly after each rep
- Based on form quality
- Higher score = better form

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **No data is sent anywhere** - everything runs locally
- **No internet needed** after initial page load
- **Camera feed stays on your device**
- Server only on local WiFi network
- No recordings or uploads

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Warm up first** - do a few practice reps to adjust positioning
2. **Start slow** - focus on form, not speed
3. **Watch metrics** - learn what angles work best for you
4. **Use landscape** - better field of view
5. **Stable mount** - tripod or stand highly recommended
6. **Good light** - face a window or use room lights
7. **Back camera** - usually higher quality than front

## 🎓 Understanding the Metrics

### Elbow Angle
- **180°** = Arm completely straight (top position)
- **120°** = Extended, rep complete
- **80°** = Target bottom position
- **50°** = Very deep (below tolerance)

### Arm-Back Angle
- **0°** = Perfectly parallel (rare)
- **<20°** = Good form, arms close to body
- **20-40°** = Acceptable (shows [PARALLEL])
- **>40°** = Arms flaring out, not counted

### Knee Angle
- **180°** = Perfectly straight legs
- **160°** = Minimum for valid plank
- **<160°** = Bent knees, position invalid
